# Coding pattern preferences

    - Always prefer simple solutions
    - Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
    - Review new code and remove unused impot and unused vars

# Code Quality Rules

    - Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of inline style objects for new markup
